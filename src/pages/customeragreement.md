## 8 Confidentiality

Each Party (the "Recipient") agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information received from the other Party (the "Discloser") during the term of this Contract and for a period of five (5) years after its termination.

The Recipient shall use the same degree of care to protect the Confidential Information as it uses to protect its own confidential information of like kind, but in no event less than reasonable care. The Recipient shall only disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, or consultants who have a need to know such information in connection with the Services and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein.

Upon termination of this Contract, or upon the Discloser's written request at any time, the Recipient shall promptly return or destroy all copies of Confidential Information received from the Discloser, except as required to comply with any applicable legal or accounting record keeping requirement.

Any unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information by the Recipient may cause irreparable harm to the Discloser, and in such event, the Discloser shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach, in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity.
